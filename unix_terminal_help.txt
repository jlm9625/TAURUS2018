Here are all the basic commands for terminal usage. Once you know them you’ll be really fast compared to everyone else. There’s lots more but you can learn them as you go

Change directory
cd Your/Directory/Spot/
move back one folder
cd ..
move to your home folder 
cd ~/

copy
>cp Path/to/file.zzz Path/to/location.zzz
for copying a folder
>cp -r Path/to/folder path/to/location

list everything in folder in order of last changed and in human read format
>ls -rtlh  

list all text files in this directory:
>ls -rtlh *.txt

show contents of a file in terminal (great for a quick look): use arrow keys navigate and q to quit.
>less filename.xyz 

move a file (like cp but deletes the source)
>mv Path/to/file.zzz Path/to/location.zzz

my location
>pwd

open finder from terminal in current folder
>open ./

open file with default program in mac:
>open filename.xyz

open file a few folder downstream:
>open folder/folder2/filename.xyz

Location Shortcuts in unix:
~/ is home so for e.g.  cd ~/Desktop would take you straight to the desktop folder
./ is where you are 
../ is upstream one folder
../../ is upstream two folders and so on
* unlimited size place holder in a filename

manual pages:
>man cmd
where cmd is any command name e.g:
>man mv 
will tell you everything about the move (mv) command
